Generate a photorealistic 3D mockup of a hardcover book with these specifications:
A professional hardcover book photographed at a 3/4 angle on a marble desk surface, with soft studio lighting. The book appears substantial, around 400 pages. The cover features a minimalist, executive design with [RandomPrimaryColor] as the dominant tone. The title "{{91.result]" appears in elegant sans-serif typography, positioned in the upper third of the cover. A matching, eye catching image is below the title, in colors and archetypal symbols that resonate and feel "right". 


Color Palette:
- Use color psychology to evoke specific emotions. Randomly select a dominant emotion and corresponding color scheme:
  - Awe: Purples, cosmic blues, and starlit silvers
  - Joy: Vibrant yellows, warm oranges, and soft pinks
  - Serenity: Aquamarines, gentle greens, and misty whites
  - Power: Bold reds, deep blacks, and metallic golds
  - Mystery: Rich indigos, shadowy grays, and luminous teals
- Use bright, eye-catching colors.


Title Integration:
- Incorporate the Book Title by engraving it on a billboard within the cover. Ensure the billboard integrates seamlessly with the environment and enhances the overall composition.


Compositional Elements:
- Use the rule of thirds, golden ratio, or dynamic symmetry for pleasing layouts.
- Create depth through layering and atmospheric perspective.
- Incorporate a surprising scale relationship between elements.
- Add small, intriguing details that invite closer examination.
