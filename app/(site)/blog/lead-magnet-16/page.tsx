          <h2>Why partner distribution works for books</h2>
          <p>Partners lend you a scarce resource: trust. A co‑branded chapter feels like a recommendation, not an ad. When the chapter teaches something useful in five minutes, the partner looks generous and you look competent. Everyone wins—including the reader who can forward the chapter to their team.</p>

          <h2>Choose partners with overlapping truth</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Same buyer, different product.</strong> Your offer should complement, not compete.</li>
            <li><strong>Education culture.</strong> They publish calm, useful content their audience expects.</li>
            <li><strong>Operational maturity.</strong> They can ship on time and measure replies.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Co‑brand the right way</h2>
          <p>Don’t slap logos on a PDF. Write a short foreword from the partner explaining why the chapter matters to their audience. Add a shared resources page with two links each. Keep the design clean and the file lightweight. The goal is an easy forward, not a brochure.</p>

          <h2>Measure replies, not just reach</h2>
          <p>Give every partner a unique link. Track “reply in 7 days” and meetings created. Share a short read‑out after each drop—what angle resonated, what questions came back, what the next experiment should be. That’s how co‑marketing becomes a program, not a one‑off.</p>
          
          <h2>Partner outreach template</h2>
          <p>Subject: “A co‑branded chapter your audience can use this week”<br/>Body: “We wrote a 6‑page chapter on [promise]. We’ll add a short intro from you and give you the ready‑to‑send email. It’s useful on its own and links back for those who want the full book.”</p>

          <h2>Legal and brand alignment</h2>
          <p>Offer editable intro copy and a light design template. Keep approvals fast by avoiding heavy design or sweeping claims. Co‑marketing should feel like borrowed trust, not borrowed headache.</p>
